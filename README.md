# Portland Schools Map

This is a basic google map and shareable web graphic for school pickup locations during COVID-19. 

## Project Purpose and Info

The purpose of this basic pickup map is to present a way to easily show food pickup locations for Portland Public Schools parents and families. The school district created a list and a press release of food locations. The first map was created and shared on March 17.

This project is solely for distributing food information on Portland Public Schools at this moment, but it can be adapted for other school districts. We were lucky to work directly with the Portland Public Schools communications team immediately after publishing the map. They provided subsequent edits and additions. 

## Setup

In order to create a new map, or add a location to the map, you need two things:

1. Add the location to the Google map. Get access here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PrA0lsow8AVcwB0imCr0TgXlCNQPFyjT&usp=sharing

2. Verify the location and hours information is properly added to the Google map.

3. Update the graphic map. We have used a basic photoshop file for updating. If you don't have photoshop, you can recreate in any graphics editor like Canva or Gimp. The image dimensions this was originally created in are: 955 px by 539 px.

4. Upload the graphic and share with the proper Portland Public Schools contact who requested the addition or change.

5. For translation: add the same locations, then change the language on the info box and the credit box. 

## Credits

This project was initially created by Em Burnett. The Portland Public Schools communications team has subsequently requested updates to the map. This documentation is to provide anyone with the ability to update the map.
